# feinbergMatching
this will store the code created as we attempt to match ems data to a stroke tracking database
This repository will house many itterations of our code.
We initially started by transforming data into the neccesary formats in R, from there we created an initial proof of concept for matching.
Once we had completed this we used the transformed data in python to create a more sophisticated matching system.
These matching systems were made in order to create validated data on what matches were true matches and which matches were false positives, or false negatives.
The goal from here on out (1/25/17) is to have the matches we have generated validated to show which ones are the same person across EMS and Stroke dataset, and then train a statistical model from there.
